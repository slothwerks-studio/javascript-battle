# Sloth's BattleScript!
## A JavaScript-powered battle program that prints to the console using concepts covered in Grand Circus' [Intro to Code Workshop](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/).

### Why was this written?

Grand Circus' ITC workshop introduces participants to the basic concepts of programming:  [variables](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/7), [boolean expressions](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/10/5), [if/else statements](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/10/22), and [loops](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/12).  With these tools in one's toolbelt, one may write some pretty cool basic programs.  It's possible, in fact, to write a game using basic logic programming.  We'll even inject into it a little bit of fun!

### Running the code

* Open [repl.it](https://repl.it/).  On the landing page, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and click on "JavaScript" in the list of programming languages.  This will open a JavaScript programming environment as described in the [ITC setup section](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/2).
* Copy the code from the [battleScript.js](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio/javascript-battle/blob/master/battleScript.js) file and paste it into the JavaScript panel in repl.it.
* Click on the "run" button near the top of the panel to see the results.

### How are you adding strings?  And for that matter... numbers _and_ strings?

Well, those are great questions not covered in the ITC workshop.  [Welcome to the loosey-goosey world of JavaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-non-grata/javascript-is-a-dysfunctional-programming-language-a1f4866e186f)!

You may use `+` to [add strings together to create a single string](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator/).  This is called *_concatenation_*.

Further, you may even add strings and numbers together to create a single string of text.  These, of course, are different [data types](https://www.grandcircus.co/slides/intro-coding/index.html#/8).  But this works in JavaScript, which assumes your goal:  ie, to [create a single string of text which happens to include the characters that make up the number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings#Numbers_vs._strings).

Does this work in other languages, such as Python?  [Not at all](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/concatenation/string-concatenation-and-formatting-in-python).  But remember:  JavaScript desperately attempts to run successfully if it can.  After all, we don't want to break the internet, do we?

### I can totally make this game more interesting.

You likely can.  And this would be a great way to [learn git and GitHub](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)!  You should totally [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), create a new file called `battleScript.js`, and create a sweet repo of your very own on [GitHub](https://github.com/).  Rock on, intrepid coder!
